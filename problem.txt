1. Custom Compiler/Interpreter
Description: Build a simple custom programming language and create a compiler or interpreter for it.
Challenges:
Implement lexical analysis to tokenize input source code.
Create a parser that converts tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
Implement semantic analysis to check for valid variable declarations, scope management, etc.
Generate intermediate or machine code, or directly interpret the code.
Optionally build in error handling and diagnostics (e.g., report syntax errors, type mismatches).
2. Event-Driven Microservice Architecture
Description: Design a set of microservices that communicate asynchronously via events (e.g., order service, payment service, notification service). Each service processes data independently and publishes/subscribes to event streams.
Challenges:
Set up a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event communication between services.
Implement event handling and retries for failed messages.
Ensure that services are decoupled and follow event-driven principles.
Build monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track service performance and uptime.
Implement distributed logging and tracing for debugging.
3. Password Manager
Description: Build a simple password manager where users can store and retrieve their passwords securely.
Challenges:
Store passwords securely using encryption.
Provide a user interface to add, view, and delete passwords.
Implement search functionality to quickly find a stored password.
Ensure data is stored locally, with optional password protection for accessing the manager.
4. Password-Protected File Vault
Description: Create an encrypted file vault that allows users to securely store sensitive files on their local machine.
Challenges:
Implement file encryption and decryption using a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).
Allow users to add, remove, and view files in the vault after entering a correct password.
Implement password hashing and salting to ensure the user's password is securely stored.
Provide functionality to export and import encrypted archives for backup purposes.
Optionally, add two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.
5.Custom Database Engine
Description: Build your own database engine from scratch, supporting basic CRUD operations, indexing, and querying.
Challenges:
Implement a storage engine to manage and retrieve records efficiently.
Support basic indexing (e.g., B-tree or hash-based indexes) to speed up queries.
Implement a simple query language (or command-based interface) that allows users to retrieve, insert, update, and delete records.
Add support for transactions with basic ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
Optimize the system for performance and ensure scalability for large datasets.
6.Custom Search Engine for Local Files
Description: Build a search engine that indexes and searches through files on the local machine (e.g., text, documents, or code files).
Challenges:
Implement an indexing system that parses and stores the contents of files in a way that enables fast searching (e.g., inverted index).
Support full-text search with features like fuzzy matching, phrase searching, and filtering by file type.
Optimize for large numbers of files and large file sizes.
Provide a user interface (or command-line interface) for users to perform searches and view results.
Optionally add file preview functionality, showing snippets around the search terms.
7.File Version Control System
Description: Build a simple version control system like Git that tracks changes to files over time and allows users to commit, view, and revert changes.
Challenges:
Implement a system that tracks file changes (e.g., diffs between versions) and stores the file history efficiently.
Allow users to commit changes, view the log of past changes, and revert to previous versions.
Build your own diff algorithm to track differences between file versions.
Add support for branching and merging changes, with conflict resolution logic.
Optimize for performance, especially with large files.
8.Local Multiplayer Game (Turn-based or Real-time)
Description: Develop a local multiplayer game that two or more players can play either via hot-seat (turn-based) or over a local network (real-time).
Challenges:
Implement the game mechanics for a two-player or multiplayer game (e.g., chess, tic-tac-toe, or a custom board game).
For real-time gameplay, implement a local networking solution to synchronize game state between players' machines.
Ensure that player inputs are correctly synchronized and conflicts (e.g., simultaneous moves) are resolved.
Optionally add AI opponents for single-player mode, but keep AI simple (non-ML-based).
Provide a UI for managing players, game setup, and displaying results.
