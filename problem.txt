Optimize for large numbers of files and large file sizes.
Provide a user interface (or command-line interface) for users to perform searches and view results.
Optionally add file preview functionality, showing snippets around the search terms.

7.File Version Control System
Description: Build a simple version control system like Git that tracks changes to files over time and allows users to commit, view, and revert changes.
Challenges:
Implement a system that tracks file changes (e.g., diffs between versions) and stores the file history efficiently.
Allow users to commit changes, view the log of past changes, and revert to previous versions.
Build your own diff algorithm to track differences between file versions.
Add support for branching and merging changes, with conflict resolution logic.
Optimize for performance, especially with large files.

8.Local Multiplayer Game (Turn-based or Real-time)
Description: Develop a local multiplayer game that two or more players can play either via hot-seat (turn-based) or over a local network (real-time).
Challenges:
Implement the game mechanics for a two-player or multiplayer game (e.g., chess, tic-tac-toe, or a custom board game).
For real-time gameplay, implement a local networking solution to synchronize game state between players' machines.
Ensure that player inputs are correctly synchronized and conflicts (e.g., simultaneous moves) are resolved.
Optionally add AI opponents for single-player mode, but keep AI simple (non-ML-based).
Provide a UI for managing players, game setup, and displaying results.
