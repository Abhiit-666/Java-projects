Testing this version control system locally is indeed manageable with your local files. Here’s how to set up and test it:

1. **Directory Setup for Testing**:
   - Choose a folder on your machine to act as a "repository" (e.g., `/my-local-vcs-test`).
   - Inside this folder, initialize your version control system by creating a `.myvcs` directory where your Java program will store metadata and version files.

2. **Test Files**:
   - Create some text files in `/my-local-vcs-test` to represent the files you’ll track, like `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.
   - Use these files for testing commands like `commit`, `checkout`, and `branch`.

3. **Sample Test Cases**:
   - **Commit**: Modify the contents of `file1.txt`, then run your `commit` command. Check `.myvcs` to ensure a new commit object is created. Verify that it reflects `file1.txt`’s changes by examining the stored snapshot or delta.
   - **Checkout**: Modify `file1.txt` again, then run `checkout <commit_id>` with a previous commit’s ID. Check if the file reverts to the older version.
   - **Branching and Merging**: Create and switch between branches, making changes to files in each branch. Then try merging branches and inspect the files to confirm that changes were correctly applied or conflicts were identified.

4. **Manual Verification**:
   - Use basic text files that are easy to inspect after each operation.
   - For more extensive tests, run diff tools (like `diff` in Unix) to check your program’s output against expected file states.

5. **Automated Tests (Optional)**:
   - Set up JUnit tests within your Java project, with sample files and assertions to verify file states after each command.
   - Automate scenarios like `commit`, `checkout`, `branch`, and `merge` to ensure consistency across various operations.
