### Parsing Tasks You Can Perform on This Log

Since the requests and responses are not next to each other, the parsing process requires matching each **`REQUEST`** and **`RESPONSE`** log using the `requestId`. Here’s how you can approach various tasks:

---

#### 1. **API Response Time Calculation**

For each request, you’ll need to:
1. Extract the `requestId` from the `REQUEST` log.
2. Search through the logs to find the matching `RESPONSE` with the same `requestId`.
3. Either use the provided `responseTime` in the `RESPONSE` log or calculate the time difference between the timestamps in the `REQUEST` and `RESPONSE` logs if both have timestamps.

#### Example Approach:
1. Read all log lines.
2. Store each `REQUEST` with the `requestId` in a map.
3. As you encounter `RESPONSE` logs, check the map for the matching `requestId`, compute the time difference, and extract the `responseTime`.

---

#### 2. **Error Analysis**

- **Track API Errors**: Look for `ERROR` or `WARN` logs in the `API_CALL` category. Capture the error messages and correlate them with the request/response cycles to identify which API calls are failing frequently.
- **Identify Slow Queries**: Search for `DB_QUERY` logs that contain errors such as timeouts or failed queries (e.g., `"Timeout after 5000ms"` or `"Duplicate entry for key 'PRIMARY'"`).

---

#### 3. **Measure API Performance**

- By tracking each `REQUEST` and `RESPONSE` log, you can calculate statistics on each API endpoint. For example:
  - Which endpoints have the longest average response times.
  - Which ones return the most errors (e.g., `400`, `500` statuses).
  - What is the distribution of response times (e.g., 95th percentile, min/max).

---

#### 4. **Cache Efficiency**

- Use `CACHE_HIT` and `CACHE_MISS` logs to track the efficiency of your caching mechanism. Analyze how often a cache miss occurs compared to cache hits, and which cache keys are frequently missed.
  
  **Cache Hit/Miss Metrics**:
  - Count how often a cache hit occurs (`CACHE_HIT`) vs. cache miss (`CACHE_MISS`).
  - Analyze which cache keys (e.g., `"user_profile_123"`) result in frequent cache misses.

---

#### 5. **Track Database Performance**

- Track `DB_CONNECTION` logs for slow connections or disconnections.
- Track `DB_QUERY` logs for failed queries or timeouts. Identify which queries are problematic by analyzing the error message content and response time.
  
  **Database Performance Metrics**:
  - How often do database timeouts occur?
  - What is the average query execution time? Are there specific queries that fail more often than others?

---

### Example Parsing Workflow:

1. **Start by reading the log line-by-line**:
   - Each line can be categorized by the `log level` (INFO, ERROR, WARN, DEBUG), `component` (API_CALL, DB_QUERY, CACHE_HIT, etc.), and the action it describes (`REQUEST`, `RESPONSE`, etc.).
   
2. **Use `requestId` to pair API requests and responses**:
   - For each API `REQUEST`, store its `timestamp`, `endpoint`, and `requestId` in a map or list.
   - For each API `RESPONSE`, search for the corresponding `REQUEST` by `requestId` and compute the response time.

3. **Store and aggregate results**:
   -

 You can use data structures like hashmaps or lists to store processed data (e.g., response times for each endpoint).
   - For errors, you can log or count the occurrences of each specific error message to generate an error report.

4. **Compute complex statistics**:
   - Calculate average response times, slowest endpoints, error rates, cache hit/miss ratios, etc.

---

### Conclusion:

By ensuring the request and response logs are interleaved with other log entries, you can create a more realistic scenario where parsing is required to link related events. This mirrors real-world log parsing tasks where log entries are not always sequentially organized. The log parser should use unique identifiers (like `requestId`) and timestamps to compute metrics, track errors, and extract performance data.
